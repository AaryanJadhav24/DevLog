# 🚀 DevLog – My Personal Developer Journey Tracker

Hey there! 👋

**DevLog** is a project I built to keep track of my coding journey — the things I learn, build, and struggle with along the way. It’s like a digital journal for developers, with a touch of AI to help make sense of patterns and habits.

I made this to sharpen my full-stack skills and document my learning process. If you're a developer (especially a student or early-career dev), I hope this inspires you to build something similar!

## 🔥 Why DevLog? (Unique Selling Proposition)

> **"DevLog is not just a journal — it's your AI-powered coding companion."**

Unlike basic note-taking apps or generic productivity tools, **DevLog** is uniquely built **for developers** to track their growth with **context-aware insights**. It combines daily logging, mood tracking, and AI analytics to help developers understand **what they're learning**, **how they're feeling**, and **where they can improve**.

### 🧠 What Makes DevLog Unique:
- ✅ **AI-Powered Reflection**: Smart insights from your logs using GPT (via OpenRouter).
- ✅ **Mood + Productivity Correlation**: See how your mindset affects your progress.
- ✅ **Developer-Focused Design**: Built with coders in mind — tags, tech focus, code-friendly input.
- ✅ **Clean, Responsive UI**: Made with React + TailwindCSS for a smooth experience.
- ✅ **Fully Open Source**: Easy to read, modify, and build on — great for learning and showcasing.

## ✍️ Dev Notes

Throughout the code, I’ve left `// Learning:` comments to explain things I found interesting or tricky while building. Hopefully, these give some insight into how I approached different problems.

I tried to stick to:
- Modular code structure
- Consistent naming
- Accessibility and responsive design
- Performance and clean UI
- Secure handling of user input (even for a personal project)
